# AWS Minikube

AWS Minikube is a single node Kubernetes deployment in AWS. It creates EC2 host and deploys Kubernetes cluster using [Kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubeadm/) tool. It provides full integration with AWS. It is able to handle ELB load balancers, EBS disks, Route53 domains etc.

## Updates

* *23.9.2017:* Bootstrap cluster purely through cloud init to skip AWS S3
* *18.9.2017:* Clarify the requirements for AWS infrastructure
* *11.9.2017:* Make it possible to connect to the cluster through the Elastic IP address instead of DNS name
* *2.9.2017:* Update to Kubeadm and Kubernetes 1.7.5
* *22.8.2017:* Update to Kubeadm and Kubernetes 1.7.4

## Prerequisites and dependencies

* AWS Minikube deployes into existing VPC / public subnet. If you don't have your VPC / subnet yet, you can use [this](https://github.com/scholzj/aws-vpc) configuration to create one.
  * The VPC / subnet should be properly linked with Internet Gateway (IGW) and should have DNS and DHCP enabled.
  * Hosted DNS zone configured in Route53 (in case the zone is private you have to use IP address to copy `kubeconfig` and access the cluster).
* To deploy AWS Minikube there are no other dependencies apart from [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io). Kubeadm is used only on the EC2 host and doesn't have to be installed locally.

## Configuration

The configuration is done through Terraform variables. Example *tfvars* file is part of this repo and is named `example.tfvars`. Change the variables to match your environment / requirements before running `terraform apply ...`.

| Option | Explanation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `aws_region` | AWS region which should be used | `eu-central-1` |
| `cluster_name` | Name of the Kubernetes cluster (also used to name different AWS resources) | `my-minikube` |
| `aws_instance_type` | AWS EC2 instance type | `t2.medium` |
| `ssh_public_key` | SSH key to connect to the remote machine | `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` |
| `aws_subnet_id` | Subnet ID where minikube should run | `subnet-8d3407e5` |
| `hosted_zone` | DNS zone which should be used | `my-domain.com` |
| `hosted_zone_private` | Is the DNS zone public or ptivate | `false` |
| `addons` | List of addons which should be installed | `[ "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scholzj/aws-minikube/master/addons//storage-class.yaml" ]` |
| `tags` | Tags which should be applied to all resources | `{ Hello = "World" }` |

## Creating AWS Minikube

To create AWS Minikube, 
* Export AWS credentials into environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* Apply Terraform configuration:
```bash
terraform apply --var-file example.tfvars
```

## Deleting AWS Minikube

To delete AWS Minikube, 
* Export AWS credentials into environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* Destroy Terraform configuration:
```bash
terraform destroy --var-file example.tfvars
```

## Addons

Currently, following addons are supported:
* Kubernetes dashboard
* Heapster for resource monitoring
* Storage class for automatic provisioning of persisitent volumes
* Route53 Mapper (Obsolete - Replaced by External DNS)
* External DNS (Replaces Route53 mapper)
* Ingress

The addons will be installed automatically based on the Terraform variables. 

## Custom addons

Custom addons can be added if needed. Fro every URL in the `addons` list, the initialization scripts will automatically call `kubectl -f apply <Addon URL>` to deploy it. Minikube is using RBAC. So the custom addons have to be *RBAC ready*.

## Tagging

If you need to tag resources created by your Kubernetes cluster (EBS volumes, ELB load balancers etc.) check [this AWS Lambda function which can do the tagging](https://github.com/scholzj/aws-kubernetes-tagging-lambda).
